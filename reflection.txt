/** Ufuk BOMBAR CS102 Hangman Homework Reflection Task **/


Problems that occurred during the merge operation:
    + Some of the functions are used without knowing the parameters, that caused whole program to fail.
    + Probably the biggest issue is the non-compliance problem. It caused unreadable codes. Thanks to god that there are automatic code formatters out.
    + Some of the javadoc params written without specifying the name. That caused javadoc errors.
    + Major bug is the space that counted as a char.
